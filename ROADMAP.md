# Burger App

## Things I Would Do Differently

- Focused on Deliverable, and unfortunately neglected testing. I would write more tests.
- I would structure the HTML a little better with more time - particularly the layout and placement of the shopping cart bag icon.

## Features I Would Add

- Ability to check out, obviously, and send the order to the restaurant
- Would save cart items to local storage
- Would add a 'favorites' feature for repeat orders
